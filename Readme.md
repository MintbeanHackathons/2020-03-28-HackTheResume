Tip: Read [General Information.md]("./General Information.md") for more info on how to get started and submit.

Today, we will build a project where we take [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) object as an input. Using this JSON object, we will output a fully-formatted resume page.

## Requirements

Take a look at the [JSON Resume Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/). Your goal is to take these fields, then build a resume using these fields.

You may either (a) display the output immediately, OR (b) save it to a file.

Required:

- You must output a resume based on JSON Resume fields
- Your resume must support all JSON Resume schema fields

You may use any GUI technology you wish:

- Templated HTML
- React
- Vue
- Angular
- Express
- Electron
- CLI (yes, you can make this a terminal-only project)

## Restrictions

Your project must use JavaScript.
There are no other restrictions.

#### Tips for success:

1. The project is intentionally simple so you can focus on code quality.
1. The requirements are intentionally minimalistic so you can get as creative as you'd like.
1. You get a LOT of time for code review comments. So you can win even if you feel your project isn't great, simply on the strength of your code review comments!
1. Keep in mind, 33% of your score is based on aesthetic appeal! So try to make it look nice.

# Today's Objective: Hack the Résumé

## Prize

$25 CAD Amazon gift card + bragging rights.

Tip: Read [General Information.md]("./General Information.md") for more info on how to get started and submit.

Today, we will build a project where we take [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) object as an input. Using this JSON object, we will output a fully-formatted resume page.

## Requirements

Take a look at the [JSON Resume Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/). Your goal is to take these fields, then build a resume using these fields.

You may either (a) display the output immediately, OR (b) save it to a file. 

Required: 
* You  must output a resume based on JSON Resume fields
* Your resume must support all JSON Resume schema fields

You may use any GUI technology you wish:
* Templated HTML
* React
* Vue
* Angular
* Express
* Electron
* CLI (yes, you can make this a terminal-only project)

## Restrictions

Your project must use JavaScript.
There are no other restrictions.

#### Tips for success:

1. The project is intentionally simple so you can focus on code quality.
1. The requirements are intentionally minimalistic so you can get as creative as you'd like.
1. You get a LOT of time for code review comments. So you can win even if you feel your project isn't great, simply on the strength of your code review comments!
1. Keep in mind, 33% of your score is based on aesthetic appeal! So try to make it look nice.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
